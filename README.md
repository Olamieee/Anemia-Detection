# Anemia Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to classify individuals as anemic or non-anemic based on clinical data. The goal is to support early detection and intervention for anemia.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalization of clinical data for analysis. <br>
- **Modeling**: Applied Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron Classifier to detect anemia.<br>
- **Evaluation**: Performance measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
The models achieved an accuracy of **99%**, indicating reliable classification performance.

## Usage
Clone the repository and open the Jupyter notebook to explore the analysis and results:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Olamieee/Anemia-Detection
```
